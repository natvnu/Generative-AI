# Generative AI in Data Science

## Project background and context:
A used car dealer has a special feature on Ford cars and wants to design a model that can predict the optimum quotation price for the cars in their lot. Sales data for the past few years have been provided. The dataset contains different features of the cars and the price they were sold at.

The task is to use Generative AI to generate a code to complete the following:

- Handle duplicate entries and missing values. 
- Perform exploratory data analysis to draw keen insights on the data and determine the effect of different features on the price. Some specific requests     are:
    - Identify number of sales for each fuel type
    - Identify which transmission type has more price outliers
- Compare the models with linear, polynomial and ridge regressions on single and multiple variables to find the best performing model
- Perform a Grid Search on the Ridge regression model to identify the optimum hyperparameter for the model for best performance

The repository contains files:
  1. prompts.txt -  the list of prompts sent to AI agent 
  2. GenerativeAIModelDevelopment.py - Python code generated by AI prompts
     
Dataset Sources: 
  The dataset contains used car sale prices for Ford cars. This is a public dataset available on the Kaggle website as Ford Car Pricing Dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/code/sametttt1/ford-car-price-prediction-93 under the CC0: Public Domain license.
  
Technologies Used: IBM Granite, Python, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, numpy

Installation: copy and run the code in Jupyter Notebooks or other Python editor of choice. Keep dataset files in the same folder.
