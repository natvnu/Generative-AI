Write a python prompt that identifies the columns with missing values and fills the blank cells with the average value. Then  identifies and drops the duplicate entries from the dataset.

Write a python code that identifies 4 attributes with highest correlation with the target attribute.

Count the number of cars under each unique value of fuelType attribute.

Create a Box plot to illustrate the correlation between variables price and transmission.

Generate the regression plot between mpg variable and the price to determine the correlation type between the two.

Fit a linear regression model to predict the price using the feature mpg. Then calculate the R^2 and MSE values for the model.

Fit a linear regression model to predict the price using the following set of features: year, mileage, tax, mpg and engineSize. Calculate the R^2 and MSE values on test data.

For the same set of features as in the question above, create a pipeline model object that uses standard scalar, second degree polynomial features and a linear regression model. Calculate the R^2 value and the MSE value for this model.

For the same set of features, split the data into 20% testing and the rest training data parts. Create and fit a Ridge regression object using the training data, set the regularization parameter to 0.1, and calculate the R^2 on the test data.

Perform a 2nd order polynomial transformation on training data and test data from the question above. Create and fit a Ridge regression using the modified training data, set the alpha parameter to 0.1, and calculate the R^2 and MSE on test data.


Perform polynomial transformation of 2nd degree on train and test data and then perform ridge regression using transformed data. Use grid search with 4 fold cross validation based on ridge regression to choose the best alpha among the following values (0.01,0.1,1,10,100)
